Fresh Bitcoin Cash Implementation

This is a new Bitcoin Cash implementation built almost completely from the ground up.
It currently uses Pieter Wuille's secp256k1 implementation. Copyright (c) 2013 Pieter Wuille

With it I hope to try performance improvements and to also add security to Bitcoin through more diverse implementations.

Keep in mind it is still in early development and needs performance improvements, code cleanup, and tests.

It is currently fully functional. There is an SPV mode, a full address to transaction database, and more.

There are features yet to be added like compact blocks.

Please feel free to send comments.
